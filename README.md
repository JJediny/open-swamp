SWAMP Backgrounder

The SWAMP is a state of-the-art software platform designed to serve as an open resource for software developers, assurance tool developers, and researchers to perform continuous software assurance (CSwA) testing in a safe, secure environment. The idea of the SWAMP was born when the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) published the Cyber Security Research and Development Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 11-02 in January of 2011. A BAA is the method used by United States government agencies to contract for basic and applied research and can be used to acquire “scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing the knowledge or understanding of a specific subject” 48 CFR 36.106(a).
